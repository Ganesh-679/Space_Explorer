            <p class="content">The formation of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) traces back to the visionary leadership of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
                 Established on August 15, 1969, ISRO was born out of a strategic vision to harness space technology for the socio-economic
                  development of India. Dr. Sarabhai, often regarded as the father of the Indian space program, recognized the potential of 
                  space applications in areas such as communication, weather forecasting, and resource management.

                Under the guidance of Dr. Sarabhai, the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set up in 1962, laying 
                the foundation for ISRO. The committee conducted pioneering experiments in space research, culminating in India's first 
                satellite, Aryabhata, launched by the Soviet Union in 1975. However, it was the formal establishment of ISRO in 1969 that
                 marked the beginning of a dedicated national space agency.
                
                ISRO's early years were marked by the development of indigenous satellite launch vehicles, leading to the successful launch 
                of the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and the deployment of India's first satellite, Rohini, in 1980. This marked a crucial
                 step toward self-reliance in space technology. Over the decades, ISRO's mission evolved from establishing a space program 
                 to addressing the country's diverse needs, including telecommunications, remote sensing, and planetary exploration.
                  Today, ISRO stands as a symbol of India's technological prowess and continues to contribute significantly to both national
                   development and global space exploration efforts.</p>
